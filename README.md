# IRONHACK-PROJECTS
## Project01 - IronSnooker 

### DESCRIPTION
This is a game made with canvas that simulate snooker

![Game Layout](https://github.com/pedroneto2/IRONHACK-PROJECTS/blob/master/images/The_game.jpg?raw=true)

### HOW TO PLAY
Just access this link: https://pedroneto2.github.io/IRONHACK-PROJECT-01/

#### THE CODE
There are still some bugs. If you would like to contribute I did some automated tests with Jest.

In order to install jest, just type in terminal inside the project folder:

`npm install`

After installed, to execute tests you can choose between

`npm run test` to execute the tests once

or

`npm run test:watch` to execute the tests while you are coding

### CONSIDERATIONS

The file 'ballCollisionPhysics.jpeg' explain the phyics I used for ball collisions.

The file 'ballColisionScheme.jpg' is a failed scheme I tried to use for ball collisions at beginning of coding,
but it helped me to understand how to get the right angles and vectors I used later

*I did this project during my Ironhack bootcamp, module 01*
